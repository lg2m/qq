description: Design a new QQ skill or agent pack: decide which you need, write the manifest and SKILL.md correctly, and validate it loads. Use when asked to create, extend, or fix a skill or pack.

# Designing A Skill Or Pack

QQ has two customization units. Pick the smaller one that fits.

| You want to... | Make a... |
| --- | --- |
| Teach the model a procedure it can pull in when relevant | **Skill** (`SKILL.md`) |
| Give the user a `/name` shortcut that runs a fixed instruction | **Command** (`name.md`) |
| Bundle a persona + skills + tool policy + model into a selectable profile | **Pack** (`pack.ron` directory) |

A skill is knowledge. A pack is an agent. Do not write a pack to hold one
skill; put the skill in `.qq/skills/` where every profile sees it.

## Where things live

```text
.qq/skills/<name>/SKILL.md          workspace skills: disclosed to every profile
.qq/commands/<name>.md              workspace commands: /name only, never disclosed
.qq/packs/<id>/pack.ron             project pack (needs `qq trust`)
~/.config/qq/packs/<id>/pack.ron    user pack, every project
```

Skills under `.agents/` and `.claude/` are read for `/name` invocation only
and are never disclosed to the model. Put anything you want the model to find
on its own under `.qq/` or a pack.

## Writing a skill

The file is `<name>/SKILL.md`. The name is 1–64 bytes, starts with a
lowercase letter, then lowercase letters, digits, `-`, `_`. Reserved names:
`models`, `sessions`, `resume`, `new`, `compact`, `quit`, `exit`.

Start with YAML front matter carrying exactly one interpreted key:

```markdown
---
description: One sentence, under 200 characters, that tells the model WHEN to load this.
---
```

The description is the only part the model sees before it decides to call
`load_skill`. Write it as a trigger, not a title: "Run the verification
gates after a Rust change" beats "Verification". If the description does
not say when, the skill is never loaded. Nothing else in the front matter is
interpreted; keep it to `description:`.

The body is plain Markdown, at most 64 KiB. Structure that works:

1. **When to use / when not to** — two or three lines.
2. **The procedure** — numbered steps with the exact commands or checks. The
   model will follow these literally; do not leave a step as "handle errors".
3. **Failure modes** — what goes wrong and what it looks like.
4. **What to report** — the shape of the answer you want back.

Rules that keep skills useful:

- One skill, one job. If you need an "and", split it.
- Prefer exact commands, file paths (`crate/src/file.rs:line`), and names
  over descriptions of them. The model can run a command; it cannot run a
  paragraph.
- Do not restate `AGENTS.md`. Reference it. Duplicated rules drift.
- A skill grants no authority. Loading one does not approve a tool or widen
  the workspace; if the procedure needs `shell`, the profile must allow it.
- Test the description by asking: given only this sentence and a user
  prompt, would the model know to load it? If not, rewrite the sentence.

## Writing a pack

A pack is a directory whose `pack.ron` declares one or more profiles. The
minimum that does something:

```ron
(
    schema: 1,
    id: "reviewer",          // 1–64 bytes: lowercase letter, then [a-z0-9-_]
    version: "0.1.0",
    name: "Code reviewer",   // optional display name
    requires: (protocol: 14),// optional; refuses to load on an older QQ
    profiles: {
        "reviewer": (
            model: "provider/model",   // optional; falls back to config
            approval_mode: read_only,  // read_only | ask | auto | full (lowercase)
            max_output_tokens: 8192,   // optional
            prompt: "prompts/persona.md",     // pack-relative, appended after AGENTS.md
            skills: ["skills"],               // dirs of <name>/SKILL.md
            commands: ["commands"],           // dirs of <name>.md
            tools: (
                deny: ["shell", "write_file", "edit_file"],  // deny wins
                // allow: ["read_file", "mcp__executor__*"]  // exact or prefix*
            ),
            mcp: ["executor"],   // subset of declared servers; absent = all
        ),
    },
    mcp: {
        // servers this pack brings with it, same shape as config.ron
    },
)
```

Bounds: 16 profiles per pack, 8 roots per list, 128 tool rules, 64 KiB
manifest, 64 KiB persona, 32 packs per load. Every profile name shares one
namespace with the `profiles:` map in `config.ron`; a duplicate is an error,
not an override. `default` cannot be declared.

Design choices worth making deliberately:

- **Tool policy is a filter, not a gate.** A denied tool is removed from the
  catalog before the model sees it. Use `deny` for "this agent must never",
  and leave the rest to approval mode. Prefer denying mutating tools over
  granting read-only ones; the built-ins are read-only by default.
- **Persona goes after `AGENTS.md`.** Write it as role, priorities, and
  output shape, not as rules the workspace file already states. Keep it
  under a screen; it costs tokens on every turn.
- **Skills in a pack are disclosed like `.qq/` skills** and show as
  `pack:<id>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Put skills in the pack only when they
  are meaningless without the persona; otherwise put them in `.qq/skills/`.
- **`mcp:` subsets narrow, never widen.** A profile can only expose servers
  the pack or the configuration declared.
- **`requires.protocol`** should be the protocol version of the QQ you
  tested against (see `docs/design/protocol.md`).

## Validate before you finish

1. `qq trust` in the project if the pack is under `.qq/packs/` and this is the
   first sensitive change. Project packs are refused untrusted, silently
   from the model's point of view.
2. Ask the server for the workspace capabilities (`POST /v1/capabilities`
   with the workspace id, or the TUI's model/profile picker). The profile
   must appear with `pack: { id, version }`. If it does not, the manifest
   failed: the loader reports `InvalidPack`, `UnsupportedPackSchema`,
   `PackProfileConflict`, or `TooManyPacks` with the pack id.
3. Start a session on the profile and check the system prompt evidence:
   `workspace_tools.skills.disclosed` counts your skills, and a denied tool
   is absent from the catalog, not merely refused.
4. Every manifest error must be typed and name the pack; if you hit a
   panic or a generic string, that is a QQ bug worth filing, not a manifest
   problem to work around.

## Anti-patterns

- A skill whose description is its name.
- A pack with an empty profile (`Profile()` is not valid RON; give it at
  least one field).
- Restating tool safety rules in a persona instead of using `tools: (deny:)`.
- A pack that carries the whole team's skills; split by role.
- Editing `.agents/` or `.claude/` expecting disclosure.
